Binary Numbers
==============

Task
----

Given a base-10 integer, n, convert it to binary (base-2). Then find and print
the base-10 integer denoting the maximum number of consecutive 1's in n's
binary representation. When working with different bases, it is common to show
the base as a subscript.

Example
-------

n = 125

The binary representation of 125 is 1111101. In base 10, there are 5 and 1
consecutive ones in two groups. Print the maximum, 5.

Input Format
------------

A single integer, n.

Output Format
-------------

Print a single base- integer that denotes the maximum number of consecutive 's
in the binary representation of .


Examples
--------

Sample 1:

```
input: 5
output: 1
```

Sample 2:

```
input: 13
output: 2
```
